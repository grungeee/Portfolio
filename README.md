# Not an actual portfolio.
>I think there is no reason for an ~~online portfolio~~ (website), as I am not offering any freelance services. 
Furthermore, my knowledge and skills are limited just to HTML, CSS, and JS, 
which is good on its own but not enough without basic Backend understanding and a bit of practice in this area.
At the moment, in order to confidently offer my skills I need a couple more projects, especially with a server and a database

## GitHub as portfolio
My GitHub is more suitable for this purpose because everyone can see what I am working on, and what I am interested in (starred repos). 
One disadvantage to this approach is that if I am setting up a NeoVim IDE for a week straight, migrating to Linux or simply have a vacation, there is almost no activity. 
Unless I do finally make something worth backing up (in the case of Vim).

### *I am learning some stuff but you can't see it :)* <br>
Some things I have no Idea how to make reusabe yet, like for example I would like to make my perfect Linux DE and run a script on ony new machine to make it **mine**, 
something I would always feel comfortable working on and never missing any tools.
